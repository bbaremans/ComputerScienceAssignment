Over the years, online web-shops like Amazon, Wish, Bol.com and nowadays Temu have been expanding with an uncontrollable speed. As these platforms keep adding new products to their product range the probability to face the exact same product on different web-shops increases. For consumers it could be valuable to know whether they come across the exact same product on different web shops. Therefore this paper investigates how duplicates can be accurately found across web shops. This paper applies preselection in terms of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to reduce the number of comparisons made and thus a reduction in computation time. Instead of using a clustering algorithm, which is extensively used in previous work on this topic, we classify possible duplicates to be real duplicates based on the same feature information such as brand, USB port and TV type.
